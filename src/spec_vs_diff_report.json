      "requirement": "Replace the existing favicon and apple-touch-icon static assets with versions derived from the user-uploaded image (image-3.png), keeping the same filenames and paths currently referenced by frontend/index.html.",
      "reason": "No changes were made to the referenced asset files under /assets/generated/, and there are no modifications shown for frontend/index.html to ensure it continues to reference the required paths.",
      "evidence": [
